README - this file


II. INSTALLATION
Method 1.
Simply put all files in your project directory. If you distribute your code than this method allows others to use gdx2oo.

Method 2.
Put the files in a local directory and add it to the PATH. Then your terminal will find them.


III. USAGE (method 1)
A) Command line use:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory (assuming your gdx file is there).
2. type: 
    ./gdx200 yourfile.gdx
    
This will create an open office spreadsheet called 'yourfile.gdx'. 
Formatting of the spreadsheet can be set by editing gdx2oo.conf.
    
Examples:
./gdx2oo -t result.ods yourfile.gdx (Sets the name of the resulting spreadsheet)
./gdx2oo --help (lists all available options)

B) Execute from the GAMS code
gdx2oo can be executed directly from the GAMS code with the standard 'execute' command.
Example:
execute_unload 'trnsport.gdx'; (creates the .gdx file)
execute './gdx2oo trnsport.gdx'; (calls gdx2oo to create the spreadsheet)

USAGE (method 2)
As the above but './' is not needed.



IV. CONFIGURATION
gdx2oo.conf can be used to set formatting options. Modify it according to your preferences. Colors can be set as html color codes. 
Available options:
* value_bg - background color of the values in the spreadsheets
* value_fg - foreground color of the values in the spreadsheets
* header_bg - background color of the header in the spreadsheets
* header_fg - foreground color of the header in the spreadsheets
* scalarsheet - indicates whether a separate sheet for scalars is included
* header - indicates whether headers in the sheets are included
